**Sensor Fault Detection ‚Äì Machine Learning**

This project focuses on identifying faults in sensor data using machine learning techniques. Sensors are commonly used in industrial applications, IoT devices, and critical systems to monitor various parameters (such as temperature, pressure, vibration, etc.). However, sensors can fail or provide inaccurate readings due to malfunction, environmental conditions, or other issues. Detecting these faults early is crucial to ensure system reliability and prevent costly failures.

**Key Objectives:**
- Collect and preprocess sensor data.
- Analyze data for patterns associated with normal and faulty sensor behavior.
- Build and train machine learning models to classify and detect sensor faults.
- Evaluate model performance and optimize for better accuracy.
- Integrate the solution for real-time or batch fault detection.

**Core Components:**
- Data ingestion pipeline for raw sensor data.
- Data cleaning and feature engineering.
- Machine learning models (such as Random Forest, SVM, or Neural Networks).
- Evaluation metrics and visualization tools.
- Deployment scripts or notebooks for inference and testing.

**Typical Applications:**
- Industrial equipment monitoring
- Predictive maintenance
- Quality assurance in manufacturing
- IoT system reliability
