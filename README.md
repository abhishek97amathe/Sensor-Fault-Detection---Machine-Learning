# Sensor Fault Detection - Machine Learning

This project aims to detect faults in sensor data using machine learning techniques. It is built in Python and is structured to facilitate experimentation, training, and deployment of models for automated fault detection in sensor-based systems.

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure

- `app.py`: Main application file to run the project.
- `upload.py`: Handles file uploads for predictions or training.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all Python dependencies.
- `setup.py`: Setup script for packaging or installation.
- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and prototyping.
- `src/`: Source code for data processing, model training, etc.
- `config/`: Configuration files for the project.
- `artifacts/`: Stores generated artifacts like trained models.
- `prediction_artifacts/`: Stores prediction results and related files.
- `static/` and `templates/`: Assets for any web interface (if applicable).

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abhishek97amathe/Sensor-Fault-Detection---Machine-Learning.git
   cd Sensor-Fault-Detection---Machine-Learning
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## üß† Features

- Sensor data ingestion and preprocessing.
- Fault detection using machine learning models.
- Modular code for easy experimentation.
- Jupyter notebooks for exploration and visualization.
- Web interface components (if `static/` and `templates/` are used).
